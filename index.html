        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Keith Brown. I am a self-taught computer programmer and
          have been for <span id="years-programmer"></span>.
          My journey started shortly after COVID hit and since then I have
          been actively learning and improving my skills. I started with doing
          basic HTML and CSS with some JavaScript mixed in and now have the
          knowledge of C, C++, Java, Python, and several others. My main goal
          for my life is to work for NASA doing software engineering. I have
          had a fascination with NASA and space ever since I was a kid and would
          like to continue on with the dreams of my younger self.
